\arguments{
\item{type}{The type of jiebaR workers including \code{mix}, \code{mp}, \code{hmm},
  \code{query}, \code{tag}, \code{simhash}, and \code{keywords}.}

\item{dict}{A path to main dictionary, default value is \code{DICTPATH},
 and the value is used for \code{mix}, \code{mp}, \code{query},
 \code{tag}, \code{simhash} and \code{keywords} workers.}

\item{hmm}{A path to Hidden Markov Model, default value is \code{HMMPATH},
and the value is used for \code{mix}, \code{hmm}, \code{query},
 \code{tag}, \code{simhash} and \code{keywords} workers.}

\item{user}{A path to user dictionary, default value is \code{USERPATH},
 and the value is used for \code{mix}, \code{tag} and \code{mp} workers.}

\item{idf}{A path to inverse document frequency, default value is \code{IDFPATH},
 and the value is used for \code{simhash} and \code{keywords} workers.}

\item{stop_word}{A path to stop word dictionary, default value is \code{STOPPATH},
 and the value is used for \code{simhash} and \code{keywords} workers.}

\item{write}{Whether to write the output to a file, or return
  a the result in a object, when the input is a file path. The
  default value is TRUE. The value

  detection is enable, the value of \code{encoding} will be
  ignore.}

\item{detect}{Whether to detect the encoding of input file
 using \code{filecoding} function. If encoding
 detection is enable, the value of \code{encoding} will be
 ignore.}

\item{symbol}{Whether to keep symbols in the sentence.}

\item{lines}{The maximal number of lines to read at one
  time when input is a file. The value
  is used for segmentation and speech tagging  workers.}

\item{output}{A path to the output file, and default worker will
  generate file name by system time stamp, the value
  is used for segmentation and speech tagging  workers.}

\item{bylines}{return the result by the lines of input files}

\value{
This function returns an environment containing segmentation
settings and worker. Public settings can be modified and got
using \code{$}.
}
\description{
This function can initialize jiebaR workers. You can initialize different
kinds of workers including \code{mix}, \code{mp}, \code{hmm},
\code{query}, \code{tag}, \code{simhash}, and \code{keywords}.
see Detail for more information.
}
\details{
The package uses initialized engines for word segmentation, and you
can initialize multiple engines simultaneously. You can also reset the model
public settings using \code{$} such as
\code{ WorkerName$symbol = T }. Some private settings are fixed
when a engine is initialized, and you can get then by
\code{WorkerName$PrivateVarible}.

Maximum probability segmentation model uses Trie tree to construct
a directed acyclic graph and uses dynamic programming algorithm. It
is the core segmentation algorithm. \code{dict} and \code{user}
should be provided when initializing jiebaR worker.

Hidden Markov Model uses HMM model to determine status set and
observed set of words. The default HMM model is based on People's Daily
language library. \code{hmm} should be provided when initializing
jiebaR worker.

MixSegment model uses both Maximum probability segmentation model
and Hidden Markov Model to construct segmentation.  \code{dict}
\code{hmm} and \code{user} should be provided when initializing
jiebaR worker.

QuerySegment model uses MixSegment to construct segmentation and then
enumerates all the possible long words in the dictionary.  \code{dict},
\code{hmm} and \code{qmax} should be provided when initializing
jiebaR worker.

Speech Tagging worker uses MixSegment model to cut word and
tag each word after segmentation using labels compatible with
ictclas.  \code{dict},
\code{hmm} and \code{user} should be provided when initializing
jiebaR worker.

Keyword Extraction worker uses MixSegment model to cut word and use
TF-IDF algorithm to find the keywords.  \code{dict} ,\code{hmm},
\code{idf}, \code{stop_word} and \code{topn} should be provided when initializing
jiebaR worker.

Simhash worker uses the keyword extraction worker to find the keywords
and uses simhash algorithm to compute simhash.  \code{dict}
\code{hmm}, \code{idf} and \code{stop_word} should be provided when initializing
jiebaR worker.
