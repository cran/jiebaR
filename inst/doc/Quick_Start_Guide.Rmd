[Chinese Version]

This is a package for Chinese text segmentation, keyword extraction
and speech tagging. `jiebaR` supports four
types of segmentation modes: Maximum Probability, Hidden Markov Model, Query Segment and Mix Segment.

## Features

+ Support Windows, Linux,and Mac.
+ Using Rcpp Modules to load different segmentation worker at the same time.
+ Support Chinese text segmentation, keyword extraction, speech tagging and simhash computation.
+ Custom dictionary path.
+ Support simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese.
+ New words identification.
+ Auto encoding detection.
+ Fast text segmentation.
+ Easy installation.
+ MIT license.

## Example

### Text Segmentation

There are four segmentation models. You can use `worker()` to initialize a worker, and then use `<=` or `segment()` to do the segmentation.

```r
library(jiebaR)

##  Using default argument to initialize worker.
cutter = worker()

##       jiebar( type = "mix", dict = "dictpath/jieba.dict.utf8",
##               hmm  = "dictpath/hmm_model.utf8",  ### HMM model data
##               user = "dictpath/user.dict.utf8") ### user dictionary

###  Note: Can not display Chinese character here.

cutter <= "This is a good day!"  

## OR segment( "This is a good day!" , cutter )

```

```r
[1] "This" "is"   "a"    "good" "day" 
```

You can pipe a file path to cut file.

```r
cutter <= "./temp.dat"  ### Auto encoding detection.

## OR segment( "./temp.dat" , cutter )   
```

The package uses initialized engines for word segmentation. You
can initialize multiple engines simultaneously.

```r
cutter2 = worker(type  = "mix", dict = "dict/jieba.dict.utf8",
                 hmm   = "dict/hmm_model.utf8",  
                 user  = "dict/test.dict.utf8",
                 detect=T,      symbol = F,
                 lines = 1e+05, output = NULL
                 ) 
cutter2   ### Print information of worker
```

```r
Worker Type:  Mix Segment

Detect Encoding :  TRUE
Default Encoding:  UTF-8
Keep Symbols    :  FALSE
Output Path     :  
Write File      :  TRUE
Max Read Lines  :  1e+05

Fixed Model Components:  

$dict
[1] "dict/jieba.dict.utf8"

$hmm
[1] "dict/hmm_model.utf8"

$user
[1] "dict/test.dict.utf8"

$detect $encoding $symbol $output $write $lines can be reset.
```

The model public settings can be modified and got using `$` , such as ` WorkerName$symbol = T `. Some private settings are fixed when the engine is initialized, and you can get them by `WorkerName$PrivateVarible`.

```r
cutter$encoding

cutter$detect = F
```

Users can specify their own custom dictionary to be included in the jiebaR default dictionary. jiebaR is able to identify new words, but adding your own new words can ensure a higher accuracy. [imewlconverter] is a good tools for dictionary construction.

```r
ShowDictPath()  ### Show path
EditDict()      ### Edit user dictionary
?EditDict()     ### For more information
```

### Speech Tagging
Speech Tagging function `<=.tagger` or `tag` uses speech tagging worker to cut word and tags each word after segmentation, using labels compatible with ictclas.  `dict` `hmm` and `user` should be provided when initializing `jiebaR` worker.

```r
words = "hello world"
tagger = worker("tag")
tagger <= words
```
```r
      x       x 
"hello" "world" 
```
### Keyword Extraction
Keyword Extraction worker use MixSegment model to cut word and use 
 TF-IDF algorithm to find the keywords.  `dict`, `hmm`, 
 `idf`, `stop_word` and `topn` should be provided when initializing  `jiebaR` worker.

```r
keys = worker("keywords", topn = 1)
keys <= "words of fun"
```
```r
11.7392 
  "fun" 
```
### Simhash Distance
Simhash worker can do keyword extraction and find 
the keywords from two inputs, and then computes Hamming distance between them.

```r
 words = "hello world"
 simhasher = worker("simhash",topn=1)
 simhasher <= words
 ```
 
 ```r
 $simhash
[1] "3804341492420753273"

$keyword
11.7392 
"hello" 
```

```r
distance("hello world" , "hello world!" , simhasher)
```

```r
$distance
[1] "0"

$lhs
11.7392 
"hello" 

$rhs
11.7392 
"hello" 
```

## Future Development

+ Support parallel programming on Windows , Linux , Mac.
+ Simple Natural Language Processing features.
